# Stair-LEDs
A really simple program for an individually addressable LED strip to light up your stairs with the help of an Arduino.

I have replaced the Arduino Uno R3 for an Arduino Nano.
The pins work fine, without any change to the code.

I also created a case.
The Arduino 3d model is downloaded through Clara.io

Sensors are a more sensible choice for a staircase so I used PIR sensors.
They are connected to 5V and Ground and their data pin can be connected directly to the appropriate button pin.
Sensor case is included too.
